      <!-- Performance Envelope Questions -->
      <h3 style="margin-bottom: var(--spacing-lg); color: var(--text-light);">Understanding Your Performance Envelope</h3>

            <h4>What is specific excess power (Ps)?</h4>
            <p class="card-text">
              Ps is the rate at which your aircraft can gain or lose energy at a given flight condition.
              Positive Ps means you have excess thrust over drag—you can climb or accelerate. Negative Ps
              means you're bleeding energy—you'll slow down or descend. Zero Ps is energy neutral: you can
              maintain that airspeed and altitude, but you have nothing left to climb or accelerate. It's
              not the edge of your envelope—it's equilibrium for those specific conditions.
            </p>
          </div>

        <div class="card">
          <div class="card-body">
            <h4>What's the corner velocity?</h4>
            <p class="card-text">
              Corner velocity is maneuvering speed (Va). It's the exact point where the lift limit (stall boundary)
              meets the load limit (structural G limit)—literally the corner of your V-n diagram. At corner velocity,
              you can pull to the aircraft's structural limit without exceeding the stall. Fly slower, and you'll
              stall before reaching max G. Fly faster, and you risk exceeding structural limits before stalling.
              It's where your aircraft turns tightest at maximum G.

          <div class="card-body">
            <h4>Why does Vy change with altitude?</h4>
            <p class="card-text">
              Best rate of climb speed (Vy) decreases with altitude because the power available and power
              required curves shift differently as air density decreases. The point of maximum excess power
              moves to a lower indicated airspeed. The EM diagram shows this clearly—you can see how the
              Ps contours shift and where maximum climb performance lives at different altitudes.

            <h4>Is Vmc really a single number?</h4>
            <p class="card-text">
              No. The published Vmc is tested under very specific conditions: max gross weight, most rearward
              CG, sea level, critical engine windmilling, 5-degree bank into the good engine, takeoff power.
              Change any variable and your actual Vmc changes. Lighter weight? Vmc goes up. Higher altitude?
              Vmc goes down. Wings level instead of banked? Vmc goes up significantly. You almost never fly
              with all the test assumptions met.

          <div class="card-body">
            <h4>What is Dynamic Vmc?</h4>
            <p class="card-text">
              Dynamic Vmc is <span class="brand-text"><span class="aero">AERO</span><span class="edge">EDGE</span></span>'s real-time calculation of your actual minimum control speed based
              on your current conditions—not the POH number. We calculate how Vmc shifts when you're at
              lighter weights, higher altitudes, different configurations, and various bank angles. Since
              you're almost never flying at the exact conditions where Vmc was tested, knowing your actual
              Vmc tells you what your real safety margins are during training and OEI flight.

          <div class="card-body">
            <h4>Why does weight affect Vmc?</h4>
            <p class="card-text">
              Lower weight means less rudder authority is needed to counteract the yawing moment from
              asymmetric thrust—but it also means the rudder produces less force at a given airspeed.
              The net effect: Vmc increases as weight decreases. That's why the POH Vmc is tested at
              max gross weight—it's the lowest (most favorable) Vmc the aircraft will see. At lighter
              training weights, your actual Vmc is higher than published.

      <!-- Steep Turn / Training Questions -->
      <h3 style="margin: var(--spacing-xl) 0 var(--spacing-lg); color: var(--text-light);">Steep Turns & Training Maneuvers</h3>
      <div class="grid grid-3">
        <div class="card">
          <div class="card-body">
            <h4>What should I understand about steep turns?</h4>
            <p class="card-text">
              The goal in a steep turn is to maintain altitude, not lose it. What the EM Diagram and
              Overlay tools show you is where you are in relation to the edges of your envelope during
              the maneuver. At 45 degrees of bank, you're at 1.4G—your stall speed has increased 19%.
              At 60 degrees, you're at 2G and stall speed is up 41%. Understanding your stall margin
              and load factor in real-time explains why instructors tell you to stay coordinated and
              not get slow—you're creeping toward the lift limit.
            </p>
          </div>

        <div class="card">
          <div class="card-body">
            <h4>Why do CFIs say "don't get slow" in steep turns?</h4>
            <p class="card-text">
              Because the stall boundary has moved toward you. In level flight, your stall speed might
              be 50 knots. In a 60-degree bank at 2G, that stall speed is now 71 knots. If you entered
              at 100 knots and let the nose drop or power decay, your margin to the stall shrinks rapidly.
              The EM diagram shows this visually—you can see exactly how much margin you have between
              your current state and the lift limit at any bank angle.

            <h4>Can I teach maneuvers with the overlay tool?</h4>
            <p class="card-text">
              Yes. The overlay tool shows students exactly what happens to energy state throughout a
              maneuver—not hand gestures or whiteboard sketches, but actual physics plotted on real
              terrain. Students can see why the maneuver is designed the way it is, where the energy
              trades happen, and what the consequences of deviations are. It's ground instruction
              that transfers directly to understanding in the aircraft.

            <h4>Can I always turn back above 1,000 feet AGL?</h4>
            <p class="card-text">
              No. The "1,000 feet and you're good" rule is an oversimplification that gets people killed.
              Whether you can make it back depends on your specific aircraft's glide performance, your
              reaction time, the wind, your weight, your actual climb gradient on that day, and how far
              you've traveled from the runway. A heavy aircraft on a hot day with a tailwind on departure
              might need significantly more than 1,000 feet. There is no universal altitude that guarantees
              a successful turnback.

          <div class="card-body">
            <h4>How do I actually brief a turnback decision?</h4>
            <p class="card-text">
              Most pilots brief an oversimplified decision matrix without any backend testing or real
              thought. "Above X altitude, I'll turn back" isn't a plan—it's a guess. A real brief accounts
              for your aircraft's glide ratio, your expected climb performance that day, the wind direction
              and velocity, and the specific geometry of the departure runway. The Overlay tool lets you
              model the actual turnback with your actual aircraft on your actual airport.

        <div class="card">
          <div class="card-body">
            <h4>How does wind affect the impossible turn?</h4>
            <p class="card-text">
              Wind changes everything. A headwind on departure (tailwind on return) significantly helps
              your turnback—you're climbing into wind and gliding back with it. A tailwind on departure
              does the opposite—you've traveled further from the runway during climb and now face a
              headwind on the glide back. The same aircraft at the same altitude might easily make it
              back with one wind condition and have no chance with another. The Overlay tool models
              this for you.

          <div class="card-body">
            <h4>What about reaction time?</h4>
            <p class="card-text">
              The delay between engine failure and beginning your turn costs altitude. The average pilot
              takes 3-5 seconds to recognize the failure and begin the turn. During that time, you're
              decelerating, possibly with the nose still climbing. That delay alone can cost you 100-200
              feet of altitude and significant distance traveled away from the runway. The Overlay tool
              lets you factor in realistic reaction times, not the instantaneous response that simple
              calculations assume.

          <div class="card-body">
            <h4>Why do aircraft performance and weight matter?</h4>
            <p class="card-text">
              A Cirrus SR22 and a Cessna 152 have very different glide ratios, climb rates, and turn
              performance. A lightly loaded trainer climbs fast, covers less ground, and glides
              efficiently. A heavy high-performance single climbs shallow, travels further, and may
              have a worse glide ratio. Your specific aircraft at your specific weight on that specific
              day determines whether the turn is possible—not a rule of thumb from ground school.

            <h4>What does the Overlay tool show me?</h4>
            <p class="card-text">
              The Overlay tool plots your actual turnback on the actual airport satellite imagery. You
              set your aircraft, weight, climb rate, wind, and reaction time. It shows you exactly where
              you'll be when you start the turn, how much altitude you'll lose in the turn, and whether
              you'll make the runway—or how short you'll be. Change any variable and watch the outcome
              change. It's the tool for making a real turnback decision, not a guess.
